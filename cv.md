3. Summary (your goal, wishes, reveal what is important for you, what do you want and why.
Some kind of self-presentation. In case of lack of experience  Junior Developer sells his/her potential, his/her passion and ability to learn fast. You shouldn't think that everybody is going to teach you when you come to the workplace . Rather being a Junior means always
learning new things from everywhere etc.).
4. Skills (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, methodologies, version control, tools etc.)
5. Code examples (LATEST)
6. Experience (for a Junior Dev it means all kinds of experience: coding tests, projects from courses,
freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
Also it would be awesome if you add links to source code)
7. Education (including courses, seminars, lectures, online learning)
8. I have been studying English at school and university for about 15 years. I've always loved to speak it and to understand more their culture. I've never talked to a native speaker before I had a chance to visit the USA via 
work&travel programm for studens. Three month of summer 2017 I spent in the US and it was the best practice of
English for me, I suppose. I worked as a waiter and everyday I communicated with native speakers who visited the 
restaurant I worked at. The whole team was also American. So English language takes a big part in my life experience.
